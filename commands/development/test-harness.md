Create comprehensive test suite for: $ARGUMENTS

Testing framework setup:
- Automatic framework detection (Jest, Vitest, pytest, etc.)
- Unit tests with mocking and isolation
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database
- End-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
- Test data factories and fixtures management
- Code coverage reporting with quality gates
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Test environment isolation and cleanup
- CI/CD integration with test automation
- Performance testing for critical paths
- Security testing integration
- Visual regression testing for UI components

Test implementation includes:
1. Test framework configuration and setup
2. Unit test templates for common patterns
3. Integration test setup with test databases
4. End-to-end test scenarios for critical user flows
5. Test data factories and mock services
6. Code coverage configuration and reporting
7. Test environment setup and teardown scripts
8. CI/CD pipeline integration
9. Test parallelization configuration
10. Performance benchmarking tests
11. Security testing integration
12. Test reporting and analytics
13. Test maintenance and cleanup procedures
14. Test documentation and guidelines

Quality gates:
- Minimum code coverage thresholds
- Test execution time limits
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance regression detection
- Code quality metrics integration
- Automated test result reporting
