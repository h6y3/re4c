# Product Requirements Document: Perspective Shift

## 1. Introduction/Overview

Perspective Shift is a single-page web application designed to help users reframe their personal struggles through the wisdom of inspirational quotes and AI-generated actionable insights. When users share what they're struggling with, the application provides three relevant quotes from real historical figures along with a reframed perspective that offers constructive solutions and emotional support.

The primary goal is to transform negative thought patterns into positive, actionable mindsets by leveraging the power of proven wisdom and AI-powered reframing techniques.

## 2. Goals

- **Primary Goal**: Help users reframe their problems constructively to improve their emotional well-being
- **Secondary Goal**: Increase user engagement through shareable, meaningful content
- **Tertiary Goal**: Create a simple, accessible tool that requires no registration or setup
- **Success Metric**: Measure success primarily through sharing frequency of generated responses

## 3. User Stories

**As a person facing a personal challenge**, I want to share my struggle so that I can receive inspirational quotes and a new perspective that helps me feel better and see actionable solutions.

**As someone seeking motivation**, I want to receive wisdom from real historical figures so that I can apply proven insights to my current situation.

**As a user who found value in the response**, I want to easily share the generated content so that others might benefit from the same wisdom and perspective.

**As a user on any device**, I want the application to work seamlessly on my phone, tablet, or desktop so that I can access help whenever I need it.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Core Input & Processing
1. **Text Input Interface**: The system must provide a clean, prominent text input box with the prompt "Share what you're struggling with"
2. **Form Validation**: The system must validate user input to ensure it's not empty and meets minimum character requirements
3. **Content Moderation**: The system must use OpenAI's moderation API to filter inappropriate or harmful content before processing
4. **Loading States**: The system must display appropriate loading indicators while processing user input

### 4.2 AI-Powered Response Generation
5. **Quote Selection**: The system must use an LLM to select 3 relevant inspirational quotes from real historical figures (no hallucinated quotes)
6. **Quote Verification**: The system must ensure all quotes are from actual people and historically accurate
7. **Perspective Reframing**: The system must generate AI-powered reframed perspectives that offer constructive, actionable solutions based on the quotes and user input
8. **Positive Tone Maintenance**: The system must ensure all generated content maintains a positive, supportive tone

### 4.3 Content Display
9. **Quote Presentation**: The system must display each of the 3 quotes with clear attribution to their authors
10. **Author Biographies**: The system must provide 1-2 sentence biographies for each quote author
11. **Reframed Perspective**: The system must present the AI-generated reframed perspective with actionable solutions in a clear, readable format
12. **Responsive Design**: The system must display content appropriately across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

### 4.4 Sharing & Export Features
13. **Copy to Markdown**: The system must allow users to copy each generated response entry in markdown format
14. **Shareable Links**: The system must generate shareable links for each response that others can access
15. **Social Sharing Integration**: The system must provide easy sharing mechanisms for the generated content

### 4.5 User Experience
16. **Mobile-First Design**: The system must prioritize mobile user experience with touch-friendly interfaces
17. **Clean, Minimal UI**: The system must focus on readability with minimal distractions
18. **Single Page Application**: The system must function as a cohesive single-page experience without page refreshes

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **User Accounts**: No user registration, login, or account management for MVP
- **Data Persistence**: No saving of user entries or response history
- **User Rating System**: No rating or feedback mechanisms for generated responses  
- **Advanced Social Features**: No commenting, community features, or user-to-user interaction
- **Paid Features**: No premium tiers or monetization features
- **Offline Functionality**: No offline access or caching capabilities
- **Multi-language Support**: English-only for MVP
- **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed user behavior tracking beyond sharing metrics

## 6. Design Considerations

### 6.1 Visual Design
- Clean, minimal interface with focus on typography and readability
- Calming color palette that promotes emotional well-being
- Clear visual hierarchy separating quotes, reframed perspective, and author information
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+)

### 6.2 User Experience Flow
1. User lands on homepage with prominent input box
2. User enters their struggle and submits form
3. Loading state displays while AI processes input
4. Results page shows 3 quotes, reframed perspective, and sharing options
5. User can copy markdown or share via link
6. User can return to homepage to submit new struggle

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Frontend Requirements
- Single-page application architecture (React, Vue, or similar)
- Responsive CSS framework or custom responsive design
- Form validation and error handling
- Loading state management
- Markdown generation functionality

### 7.2 Backend Requirements
- LLM integration (OpenAI GPT, Claude, or similar) for quote selection and perspective generation
- OpenAI Moderation API integration for content filtering
- Quote verification system to prevent hallucinated quotes
- API endpoints for processing user input and generating responses
- Shareable link generation and routing

### 7.3 Performance & Reliability
- Response time under 10 seconds for typical user input
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- Input sanitization and security measures
- Mobile performance optimization

## 8. Success Metrics

### 8.1 Primary Metrics
- **Sharing Frequency**: Number of generated responses shared via links per week/month
- **Share-to-Generation Ratio**: Percentage of generated responses that get shared

### 8.2 Secondary Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Average time spent reading generated responses
- **Return Usage**: Users who submit multiple struggles in a session
- **Mobile Usage**: Percentage of traffic from mobile devices

## 9. Open Questions

1. **API Rate Limiting**: How should we handle high-volume usage and potential API rate limits?
2. **Quote Database**: Should we maintain a curated backup database of verified quotes for reliability?
3. **Response Length**: Are there optimal length guidelines for the reframed perspectives?
4. **Error Recovery**: How should the system behave when the LLM fails to generate appropriate quotes?
5. **Content Caching**: Should frequently requested similar struggles have cached responses for faster delivery?
6. **Analytics Implementation**: What specific analytics tools should track sharing frequency without compromising user privacy?
