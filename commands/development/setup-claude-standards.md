# /setup-claude-standards - Universal CLAUDE.md Generator

**Purpose**: Generate and deploy a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with production-ready development standards synthesized from 47+ battle-tested development commands

**Philosophy**: Production-first, security-by-design, automation-driven development practices that work across any language or framework

**Use Cases**:
- Setting up new projects with proven development standards
- Standardizing existing projects with best practices
- Creating team-wide development guidelines
- Establishing quality gates and automation workflows

## Process Overview

If project type is specified (e.g., "next.js", "python", "go", "full-stack"):
- Generate project-specific CLAUDE.md with tailored recommendations
- Include framework-specific tooling and patterns
- Customize examples for the technology stack

If no project type specified:
- Generate universal CLAUDE.md applicable to any project
- Provide language-agnostic principles and patterns
- Include adaptation guidelines for different stacks

## Implementation Process

1. **Assess Current Project State**:
   - Check if CLAUDE.md already exists
   - Analyze existing project structure and technology stack
   - Identify current development practices and gaps

2. **Generate Comprehensive CLAUDE.md**:
   - Synthesize best practices from 47+ production commands
   - Include production-first development philosophy  
   - Add security-by-design standards
   - Integrate automation-first approach principles
   - Provide universal architecture patterns
   - Include language-specific adaptations (if project type specified)

3. **Deploy Development Standards**:
   - Place CLAUDE.md in project root or user's global directory
   - Set up recommended tooling configuration files
   - Initialize quality gates and automation workflows
   - Configure pre-commit hooks and CI/CD templates

4. **Provide Implementation Guidance**:
   - Generate implementation checklist for immediate next steps
   - Suggest team adoption strategies
   - Recommend gradual migration approach for existing projects
   - Provide success metrics and evaluation criteria

## Generated CLAUDE.md Structure

The universal CLAUDE.md includes these comprehensive sections:

### Core Development Philosophy
- Production-first mindset with scalability from day one
- Quality-driven development with comprehensive testing
- Automation-first approach with CI/CD integration
- Security-by-design principles throughout

### Universal Architecture Principles
- System design patterns (separation of concerns, DDD, event-driven)
- Scalability patterns (stateless design, caching, circuit breakers)
- Data architecture (schema design, validation, audit trails)
- Performance optimization strategies

### Security Standards
- Authentication & authorization best practices
- Data protection and encryption requirements
- Vulnerability management processes
- Compliance considerations (GDPR, CCPA, industry-specific)

### Development Workflow
- Git workflow with conventional commits
- Code quality standards and naming conventions
- Comprehensive testing strategy (unit → integration → E2E)
- Code review processes and knowledge sharing

### Language-Specific Best Practices
- TypeScript/JavaScript with strict configurations
- Python with type hints and Pydantic validation
- Database design with proper indexing and security
- API design patterns and error handling

### Performance & Infrastructure
- Frontend optimization (code splitting, caching, Core Web Vitals)
- Backend optimization (database, API, monitoring)
- Deployment standards (CI/CD, environment management)
- Monitoring and observability requirements

### Implementation Guidelines
- Project setup checklist with security and performance
- Technology stack recommendations for different use cases
- Success metrics and evaluation criteria
- Adaptation guidelines for different contexts
