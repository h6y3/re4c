**re4c** (Rapid Engineering For Claude) is a comprehensive, turnkey command collection and workflow system for Claude Code that implements best practices for AI-assisted software development.

## üôè Inspiration & Credits

re4c is inspired by and builds upon the excellent work of [Ryan Carson](https://github.com/snarktank) and the [ai-dev-tasks repository](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks). The core workflow concepts were originally demonstrated in Ryan's [YouTube video on AI development workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD4ktSkNCw4).

While many of the original commands have evolved significantly, the fundamental insight remains: **AI-assisted development requires systematic workflows, proper context building, and rigorous validation**.

### Key Philosophical Extensions

#### 1. Context-First Development
Much of rapid engineering requires **building context before beginning implementation**. This is why re4c emphasizes the sequential use of:

- **`/create-prd`** - Establishes business context and requirements
- **`/create-drd`** - Defines design context and user experience  
- **`/create-trd`** - Specifies technical context and architecture

This sequence ensures the AI has comprehensive context before generating implementation tasks, preventing architectural drift and ensuring requirements alignment.

#### 2. Shape Up Methodology Integration
re4c borrows heavily from [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) by Basecamp, particularly:

- **Fixed Time, Variable Scope**: Complexity budgets prevent endless feature creep
- **Vertical Slices**: Each slice delivers user value, not just technical milestones
- **Circuit Breakers**: Built-in simplification strategies when complexity exceeds budget
- **No Estimation Time**: AI-appropriate complexity scoring instead of time estimates

The **Slice methodology** is core to preventing unusable builds and drift. Each vertical slice:
- Delivers working, demonstrable functionality
- Maintains deployable state
- Can be validated independently
- Has clear success criteria

#### 3. Agent-Does-All-Work Philosophy
re4c assumes the AI agent should handle the complete development lifecycle:

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Mandatory Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **Multi-Agent Validation**: Specialized validation agents with blocking authority
- **MCP Integration**: Leverages tools like Playwright for automated UI testing
- **Quality Gates**: No progression without validation approval

This approach ensures consistent quality while freeing developers to focus on high-level design and business requirements rather than implementation details.

### Additional Key Features

#### Multi-Agent Orchestration
re4c includes advanced **multi-agent workflow capabilities** (`/multiagent-worktree`) that can coordinate parallel development streams using git worktrees. This allows complex features to be developed by multiple AI agents simultaneously while maintaining code quality and preventing conflicts.

#### Universal Development Standards
The system enforces **production-ready development standards** through a comprehensive `universal-claude.md` configuration that ensures:
- Type safety and comprehensive validation
- Multi-layer testing strategies (unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí E2E)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with quality gates
- Production-first mindset with observability and error handling

#### Validation-First Quality Gates
Every slice completion requires approval from **specialized validation agents**:
- **Architecture Review**: Technical implementation and maintainability
- **TDD Compliance**: Proper test-driven development practices
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices
- **UI Testing**: Playwright automation with visual regression testing
- **Workspace Cleanup**: Repository integrity and development environment hygiene

## üéØ What is re4c?

re4c provides a complete toolkit of 42 carefully crafted commands organized around a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** workflow with **multi-agent validation** and **systematic knowledge capture**. It transforms Claude Code from a general-purpose AI assistant into a specialized engineering partner that enforces quality gates, maintains clean code practices, and captures learnings systematically.

### Key Features

- **üß™ Mandatory TDD**: All code changes follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- **üîç Multi-Agent Validation**: 5 specialized validation agents with blocking authority
- **üé≠ Playwright Integration**: Automatic UI testing with screenshots
- **üìù Learning Capture**: Mandatory retrospectives after every development slice
- **üîß Resource Utilization**: MCP Context7, script discovery, proper URL management
- **üßπ Workspace Cleanup**: Repository integrity validation
- **üìä AI-Appropriate Estimation**: Complexity scoring instead of time-based estimates

## üìã Philosophy & Core Concepts

re4c implements a systematic approach to AI-assisted development based on proven methodologies:

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Red**: Write failing tests first
- **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests  
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
- **Mandatory**: No code without tests, no exceptions

### Complexity-Based Estimation  
Instead of time estimates (inappropriate for AI), re4c uses complexity scoring:
- **1-3**: Simple changes, quick implementation
- **4-6**: Moderate complexity, some research needed
- **7-9**: Complex features, multiple components
- **10**: Maximum complexity, consider breaking down

### Multi-Agent Validation
Quality gates prevent completion until all validation agents approve:
- Ensures consistent quality
- Catches issues early
- Maintains architectural integrity
- Enforces testing standards

### Systematic Learning Capture
Mandatory retrospectives after every slice:
- Document lessons learned
- Update project understanding  
- Adapt future planning
- Prevent knowledge loss

### Slices vs Tasks
- **Tasks**: Traditional sequential work items
- **Slices**: Vertical cuts through all application layers that deliver user value
- **Why Slices**: Better for AI development, maintain deployable state, easier validation

### Validation Agents
Specialized agents with expertise in specific domains:
- **Architecture**: System design, coupling, scalability
- **TDD**: Test quality, coverage, Red-Green-Refactor compliance  
- **UI Testing**: Playwright automation, screenshot validation
- **UX Evaluation**: User experience, accessibility, usability
- **Cleanup**: Repository integrity, workspace cleanliness

### Resource Utilization
re4c mandates proper use of available tools:
- **MCP Context7**: API documentation and framework knowledge
- **Playwright**: Web UI testing and navigation
- **Script Discovery**: Use existing project scripts
- **Correct URLs**: Always production URLs, never development

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Complete Example: Building "Perspective Shift" Application

We'll walk through building a real single-page web application that helps users reframe their struggles through inspirational quotes. Full sample documents are available in the `./samples` directory.

#### Step 1: Create Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Start by defining what you want to build. Be specific about features and requirements:

```bash
/create-prd "Build a single-page web application with the following requirements:

**Core Functionality:**
- Homepage with text input box prompting 'Share what you're struggling with'
- On form submission, display response containing:
  - 3 relevant inspirational quotes from real historical figures
  - Reframed perspective with actionable solutions based on quotes
  - Brief author biography for each quote
- Copy-to-markdown functionality for each entry
- Social media sharing buttons

**Technical Requirements:**
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Clean, minimal UI focusing on readability
- Form validation and loading states
- OpenAI API integration for quote selection and reframing
- Text processing to match user input with relevant quotes"
```

This generates `prd-perspective-shift.md` in your `/tasks` directory.

#### Step 2: Create Design Requirements Document (DRD)

Transform your PRD into concrete design specifications:

```bash
/create-drd prd-perspective-shift.md
```

The AI will ask clarifying questions about:
- Visual design preferences (colors, typography, spacing)
- User flow and interaction patterns
- Component hierarchy and responsive behavior
- Error states and loading feedback

This generates `drd-perspective-shift.md` with complete UI/UX specifications.

#### Step 3: Create Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

Convert requirements into technical architecture:

```bash
/create-trd prd-perspective-shift.md drd-perspective-shift.md
```

The AI will determine:
- System architecture (Next.js + Supabase + OpenAI)
- Database schema and API design
- Integration patterns and security requirements
- Performance targets and caching strategies

This generates `trd-perspective-shift.md` with implementation details.

#### Step 4: Generate Implementation Tasks or Slices

Choose your development approach:

**Option A: Task-Based Development**
```bash
/generate-tasks prd-perspective-shift.md
# Creates detailed task list with sub-tasks
```

**Option B: Vertical Slice Development (Recommended)**
```bash
/generate-slices prd-perspective-shift.md 10
# Creates vertical slices within 10 complexity points
```

#### Step 5: Begin Implementation with TDD

```bash
/process-slices 0  # Start with Slice 0 (static mockup)
```

The system will:
1. Write tests first (Red phase)
2. Implement features (Green phase) 
3. Refactor code (Refactor phase)
4. Run validation agents
5. Take Playwright screenshots for UI testing

### 2. Sample Documents

Complete example documents for the "Perspective Shift" application are available in the `./samples` directory:

- **`prd-perspective-shift.md`** - Full product requirements with user stories and functional specs
- **`drd-perspective-shift.md`** - Comprehensive design specifications with component hierarchy
- **`trd-perspective-shift.md`** - Technical architecture with database schema and API design
- **`tasks-perspective-shift.md`** - Generated task list ready for implementation

These samples demonstrate the complete workflow from requirements to implementation-ready tasks.

### 3. Multi-Agent Development

```bash
# For complex features requiring parallel development
/process-slices-multiagent
```

### 4. Mandatory Validation Gates

Every slice completion requires validation from:
- **Architecture Validation Agent**: Structural integrity
- **TDD Validation Agent**: Test coverage and quality  
- **UI Testing Agent**: Playwright testing (for UI work)
- **UX Evaluation Agent**: User experience validation (for new UI)
- **Cleanup Validation Agent**: Repository cleanliness

### 5. Learning Capture

```bash
# After every slice (mandatory)
/slice-retrospective slice-name
```
