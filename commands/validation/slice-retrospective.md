# /slice-retrospective - Mandatory Post-Slice Learning and Planning Update

**Purpose**: Capture lessons learned, update project plans, and transfer knowledge after every slice completion

**Authority**: MANDATORY - Required after every slice, regardless of size or complexity

**Philosophy**: Continuous improvement through systematic learning capture and adaptive planning

## Core Requirements

### Mandatory After Every Slice
- **No exceptions**: Every slice must have a retrospective
- **Immediate execution**: Run immediately after slice completion validation
- **Documentation**: All insights must be documented in `/docs/retrospectives/`
- **Plan updates**: Project plans must be updated based on learnings

### Knowledge Transfer Goals
1. **Capture lessons learned**: Document what worked, what didn't, and why
2. **Update project understanding**: Revise assumptions and requirements
3. **Adapt future planning**: Reorder priorities based on new information
4. **Prevent knowledge loss**: Ensure insights survive session boundaries

## Retrospective Framework

### Phase 1: Completion Analysis
**Question Set**: What was actually accomplished?

1. **Tasks Completed**: List all tasks marked as done
2. **Scope Changes**: Identify any scope modifications during implementation
3. **Unexpected Work**: Document work not originally planned
4. **Technical Decisions**: Record significant technical choices made
5. **Blockers Resolved**: Note how obstacles were overcome

**Output**: Comprehensive completion summary with deviations from plan

### Phase 2: Learning Capture
**Question Set**: What did we learn during this slice?

#### Technical Learnings
- **New patterns discovered**: Code patterns, architecture insights, tool usage
- **Performance insights**: What worked well, what was slow
- **Integration challenges**: Unexpected API behaviors, compatibility issues
- **Testing revelations**: Test patterns that worked, testing challenges
- **Tool discoveries**: New tools found, better ways to use existing tools

#### Process Learnings  
- **Estimation accuracy**: How accurate were complexity estimates?
- **Workflow effectiveness**: Which processes helped/hindered progress
- **Communication insights**: What information was missing or helpful
- **Resource utilization**: How well were available tools/resources used
- **Validation effectiveness**: How well did quality gates work?

#### Context and Requirements Learnings
- **Requirement clarifications**: What requirements were misunderstood initially?
- **User needs insights**: Better understanding of user problems
- **Business context evolution**: Changes in business priorities or constraints
- **Technical constraint discoveries**: New limitations or capabilities found
- **Integration requirement changes**: Updates to external system requirements

**Output**: Structured learning documentation with actionable insights

### Phase 3: Project Plan Assessment
**Question Set**: How should this learning change our plans?

#### Task Relevance Review
1. **Still Relevant**: Which remaining tasks are still necessary?
2. **No Longer Relevant**: Which tasks can be removed or significantly modified?
3. **New Tasks Discovered**: What new tasks emerged from implementation learning?
4. **Priority Changes**: Which tasks should move up/down in priority?
5. **Dependency Updates**: How do new learnings affect task dependencies?

#### Scope and Timeline Impact
1. **Scope Adjustments**: Should project scope be expanded or reduced?
2. **Complexity Reassessment**: Were original complexity estimates accurate?
3. **Resource Requirements**: Do we need different tools or capabilities?
4. **Risk Updates**: What new risks were discovered or mitigated?
5. **Success Criteria Evolution**: Should success metrics be updated?

#### Next Slice Planning
1. **Next Logical Step**: Is the next planned slice still the right priority?
2. **Preparation Requirements**: What preparation is needed for the next slice?
3. **Context Handoff**: What context must be preserved for future work?
4. **Tool Setup**: What tools or configurations are needed for upcoming work?

**Output**: Updated project plan with revised priorities and scope

### Phase 4: Knowledge Documentation
**Question Set**: How do we preserve and share these insights?

#### Documentation Updates
- **README updates**: User-facing documentation changes needed
- **Technical documentation**: Architecture, API, or implementation docs to update
- **Development guides**: Process or setup documentation improvements
- **Troubleshooting guides**: New solutions to capture for common issues

#### Decision Records
- **Architecture decisions**: Significant technical choices made
- **Tool selections**: Why specific tools or approaches were chosen
- **Trade-off decisions**: Performance vs. complexity vs. maintainability choices
- **Process decisions**: Workflow or methodology choices

#### Future Considerations
- **Technical debt created**: Shortcuts taken that need future attention
- **Optimization opportunities**: Performance or quality improvements identified
- **Refactoring candidates**: Code that should be improved later
- **Feature enhancements**: User experience improvements discovered

**Output**: Updated documentation and decision records
