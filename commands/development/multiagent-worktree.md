# Multi-Agent Workflow Command

## Overview

This advanced Claude Code command orchestrates parallel multi-agent development using git worktrees and specialized subagents. Based on proven patterns from successful implementations, this command manages complex tasks through coordinated AI teams while maintaining code quality and universal scaffold integrity.

## Usage

```bash
/multiagent-worktree [task-description] [complexity:1-5] [urgency:low|medium|high] [agents:1-5]
```

**Examples:**

- `/multiagent-worktree "Implement user authentication system" 4 high 3`
- `/multiagent-worktree "Add dark mode to UI components" 2 medium 2`
- `/multiagent-worktree "Optimize database queries and caching" 3 low 2`
- `/multiagent-worktree "Build payment processing system" 5 high 4`

## Command Parameters

- **task-description**: Natural language description of the feature/task
- **complexity**: 1-5 scale (1=simple, 5=complex multi-system integration)
- **urgency**: low|medium|high (affects parallelization strategy)
- **agents**: 1-5 number of parallel agents (optional, auto-calculated if omitted)

## Pre-Execution Analysis

Before creating any worktrees, analyze:

### Complexity Assessment

**Level 1 (Simple):** Single file modifications, no dependencies **Level 2 (Basic):** Few files, minimal coordination needed
 **Level 3 (Moderate):** Multiple files, some interdependencies **Level 4 (Complex):** Cross-system changes, significant coordination **Level 5 (Advanced):** Full-stack integration, multiple systems affected

### Task Decomposition Strategy

- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks that must be completed in order
- **Parallel-Safe Components**: Independent work streams
- **Shared Foundations**: Common code that multiple agents need
- **Integration Points**: Where parallel work comes together

### Resource Planning

- **Token Budget**: 3-4x normal consumption for multi-agent workflows
- **Development Environment**: Each worktree needs full setup
- **Testing Isolation**: Independent test environments per worktree
- **Merge Complexity**: Estimate coordination overhead

## Git Worktree Management

### Worktree Creation Strategy

```bash
# Foundation-First Pattern (Recommended for Complex Tasks)
git worktree add ../project-foundation -b workflow/foundation-$TASK_ID
git worktree add ../project-agent1 -b workflow/agent1-$TASK_ID  
git worktree add ../project-agent2 -b workflow/agent2-$TASK_ID
git worktree add ../project-integration -b workflow/integration-$TASK_ID

# Parallel Pattern (For Independent Components)
git worktree add ../project-backend -b workflow/backend-$TASK_ID
git worktree add ../project-frontend -b workflow/frontend-$TASK_ID
git worktree add ../project-testing -b workflow/testing-$TASK_ID
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Branch Format**: `workflow/[role]-[task-id]-[timestamp]`
- **Directory Format**: `../project-[role]-[task-short-name]`
- **Task ID**: Short kebab-case identifier (e.g., "auth-system", "payment-flow")

### Environment Setup Automation

For each worktree, automatically:

1. **Copy Environment Files**: `.env`, `.envrc`, configuration files
2. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, etc.
3. **Setup Development Database**: Copy or link test databases
4. **Configure Port Allocation**: Assign unique ports for parallel testing
5. **Initialize Git Hooks**: Copy project-specific git hooks
6. **Setup IDE Configuration**: Copy `.vscode/settings.json`, etc.

```markdown
## AGENT CONTEXT PACKAGE

### Universal Scaffold Principles
- CRITICAL: NO app-specific implementations - maintain universal flexibility
- ALL implementations must work across all app slots (app1-app5)
- Use namespace isolation patterns with appId parameters
- Follow existing universal patterns in the codebase
- NEVER hardcode app-specific values or paths

### Your Specialization: [AGENT_TYPE]
**Primary Role**: [Detailed role description]
**Core Responsibilities**: 
- [Specific responsibility 1]
- [Specific responsibility 2]
- [Specific responsibility 3]

**Tools Available**: [List of MCP tools and permissions]

### Task Scope: [SPECIFIC_TASKS]
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Specific deliverable 1 with acceptance criteria
- [ ] Specific deliverable 2 with acceptance criteria  
- [ ] Specific deliverable 3 with acceptance criteria

**Completion Definition**: [Clear, measurable completion criteria]

### Coordination Protocol
**Dependencies**:
- **Requires from Foundation Agent**: [What you need before starting]
- **Requires from [Other Agent]**: [Specific dependencies]
- **Provides to [Other Agent]**: [What others are waiting for from you]

**Parallel-Safe Work**: [What you can do independently]

**Communication Protocol**:
- **Start Signal**: [How you know when to begin]
- **Progress Updates**: Create PROGRESS.md with status every 30 minutes
- **Completion Signal**: [How you signal completion]
- **Blocking Issues**: [How to escalate problems]

### Quality Gates
**Before Starting**:
- [ ] Foundation dependencies met
- [ ] Required context files read
- [ ] Environment setup validated

**During Development**:
- [ ] Progress tracked in PROGRESS.md
- [ ] Build validation passes: `npm run build`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] No universal scaffold violations

**Before Completion**:
- [ ] All deliverables completed
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Code review self-check complete
- [ ] Documentation updated

### File Patterns to Follow
**Read These Files First**:
- [Specific examples from existing codebase]
- [Pattern files that show the right approach]
- [Related implementations to understand context]

**Naming Conventions**:
- [Project-specific naming patterns]
- [Universal scaffold naming requirements]

### Error Handling Requirements
**Consistent Patterns**:
- [Error handling patterns to maintain]
- [Logging requirements]
- [User-facing error message standards]

### Integration Points
**APIs to Maintain**:
- [Interface contracts that must be preserved]
- [Type definitions that must be compatible]

**Testing Requirements**:
- [Specific test coverage requirements]
- [Integration test patterns to follow]

### Emergency Protocols
**If Blocked by Dependencies**:
1. Document the blocking issue in PROGRESS.md
2. Create mock/stub implementation to continue
3. Flag for integration resolution

**If Quality Gates Fail**:
1. Stop all work immediately
2. Document the failure in PROGRESS.md
3. Request assistance from Quality Assurance Agent

**If Universal Scaffold Violation Detected**:
1. STOP - Do not proceed
2. Review universal patterns in codebase
3. Redesign approach to maintain universality
4. Document the violation and resolution

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- Use TodoWrite tool to track all progress
- Read existing files before editing to understand patterns
- Validate work with build tools before marking complete
- Communicate clear status updates for coordination
- When in doubt about universal patterns, ASK before proceeding
```

## Coordination Strategies

### Strategy Selection by Complexity and Urgency

**Low Complexity + Low Urgency: Sequential Coordination**

```
Foundation Agent → Complete → Backend Agent → Complete → Frontend Agent → Complete
```

- Minimal coordination overhead
- Maximum quality control
- Suitable for simple tasks

**Medium Complexity + Medium Urgency: Pipeline Coordination**

```
Foundation Agent → 50% Complete → Backend Agent Starts
Backend Agent → 50% Complete → Frontend Agent Starts
All agents → Sync at 75% → Integration Agent Merges
```

- Balanced speed and coordination
- Regular sync points prevent drift

**High Complexity + High Urgency: Parallel Coordination with Guard Rails**

```
Foundation Agent → Complete Core Interfaces (CRITICAL PATH)
     ↓
[Backend, Frontend, Testing] Agents → Start Simultaneously
     ↓
Regular Sync Points Every 30 Minutes
     ↓
Integration Agent → Continuous Merge and Validate
```

- Maximum parallelization
- Requires robust coordination
- Higher token consumption acceptable

### Coordination Tools and Protocols

**Progress Tracking**:

- Each agent maintains `PROGRESS.md` with real-time status
- Central `COORDINATION.md` tracks cross-agent dependencies
- Automated status checks every 30 minutes

**Communication Protocol**:

- **Green Light**: Dependency completed, next agent can proceed
- **Yellow Light**: Work in progress, coordinate before proceeding
- **Red Light**: Blocking issue, all dependent work should pause

**Conflict Resolution**:

- **Preventive**: Clear interface contracts defined upfront
- **Detective**: Regular build and integration testing
- **Corrective**: Designated integration agent resolves conflicts

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Pre-Execution Quality Gates

- [ ] Task complexity accurately assessed
- [ ] Dependencies mapped and validated
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Agent specializations appropriate for task
- [ ] Coordination strategy selected and communicated
- [ ] Universal scaffold compliance plan established

### During-Execution Monitoring

- [ ] Progress tracking via PROGRESS.md files
- [ ] Build validation passes in all worktrees
- [ ] No universal scaffold violations detected
- [ ] Regular sync points maintained
- [ ] Token consumption within budget
- [ ] Quality standards maintained

### Pre-Completion Validation

- [ ] All deliverables completed and validated
- [ ] Integration testing successful across all components
- [ ] Universal scaffold integrity confirmed
- [ ] Documentation updated and complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied

## Merge and Integration Strategies

### Cherry-Pick Strategy (Recommended for Quality)

```bash
# After all agents complete
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Cherry-pick the best implementations
git cherry-pick workflow/foundation-auth-system
git cherry-pick workflow/backend-auth-system  
git cherry-pick workflow/frontend-auth-system

# If conflicts arise during cherry-pick
git cherry-pick --abort
# Mark task for manual review and restart with sequential approach
```

### Three-Way Merge Strategy (For Complex Integration)

```bash
# Create integration branch
git checkout -b integration/auth-system-$TIMESTAMP

# Merge foundation first
git merge workflow/foundation-auth-system

# Merge other components
git merge workflow/backend-auth-system
git merge workflow/frontend-auth-system

# Resolve conflicts and test
npm run build && npm run test

# Only merge to main if all tests pass
git checkout main
git merge integration/auth-system-$TIMESTAMP
```

### Rollback Strategy (If Integration Fails)

```bash
# Clean rollback procedure
git checkout main
git branch -D integration/auth-system-$TIMESTAMP

# Clean up all worktrees
git worktree remove ../project-foundation-auth
git worktree remove ../project-backend-auth
git worktree remove ../project-frontend-auth

# Mark task for redesign with simpler approach
echo "❌ Multi-agent approach failed - reverting to sequential" >> COORDINATION.md
```

## Emergency Protocols and Recovery

### Agent Failure Recovery

**Symptoms**: Agent stops responding, produces invalid code, violates constraints

**Recovery Procedure**:

1. **Immediate**: Stop the failed agent and quarantine its worktree
2. **Assessment**: Determine what percentage of work was completed successfully
3. **Salvage**: Extract any usable code or patterns from failed attempt
4. **Redistribution**: Assign remaining work to functioning agents or new agent
5. **Validation**: Ensure quality maintained despite the failure

### Coordination Breakdown

**Symptoms**: Agents working on conflicting implementations, integration failures

**Recovery Procedure**:

1. **Stop**: Immediately halt all parallel work
2. **Assess**: Identify root cause of coordination failure
3. **Redesign**: Switch to simpler coordination strategy (sequential if necessary)
4. **Restart**: Begin again with improved coordination protocols

### Universal Scaffold Violations

**Symptoms**: App-specific implementations detected, namespace violations

**Recovery Procedure**:

1. **Critical Stop**: Halt all work immediately
2. **Audit**: Review all changes for universal compliance
3. **Remediation**: Fix violations or rollback to clean state
4. **Education**: Update agent context to prevent recurrence
5. **Validation**: Confirm universal patterns maintained

### Resource Exhaustion

**Symptoms**: Excessive token usage, system resource conflicts

**Recovery Procedure**:

1. **Triage**: Identify highest-value agents to continue
2. **Pause**: Temporarily suspend lower-priority agents
3. **Optimization**: Reduce context and focus on critical path
4. **Sequential Fallback**: Switch to sequential execution if necessary

## Best Practices and Gotchas

### ✅ What Works (Proven Patterns)

**Clear Task Boundaries**:

- Each agent has specific, non-overlapping responsibilities
- Interface contracts defined before parallel work begins
- Success criteria are measurable and testable

**Foundation-First Architecture**:

- Critical shared code completed before parallel work
- Database schema and type definitions established early
- Universal patterns documented and enforced

**Regular Coordination Checkpoints**:

- 30-minute progress updates prevent drift
- Build validation catches integration issues early
- Cross-agent communication via shared documentation

**Robust Environment Setup**:

- Automated worktree creation with full environment
- Unique port allocation prevents resource conflicts
- Consistent development setup across all worktrees

### ❌ What Doesn't Work (Avoid These Patterns)

**Vague Completion Criteria**:

- "Make it work" leads to inconsistent implementations
- Unclear success definitions cause coordination delays
- Missing acceptance criteria result in quality variations

**Insufficient Foundation Work**:

- Parallel agents without shared interfaces create conflicts
- Missing type definitions lead to integration failures
- Inadequate universal patterns cause scaffold violations

**Over-Parallelization**:

- Too many agents increase coordination overhead exponentially
- Token consumption becomes unsustainable
- Quality suffers under excessive coordination burden

**Inadequate Testing Strategy**:

- Lack of integration testing catches conflicts too late
- Missing environment isolation causes test interference
- Insufficient quality gates allow problems to compound

### 🔧 Critical Optimizations

**Token Management**:

- Use specialized agents to reduce context switching
- Implement context pruning for long-running sessions
- Monitor token consumption and adjust strategy accordingly

**Development Environment**:

- Share node_modules and dependencies where possible
- Use pnpm for automatic package deduplication
- Implement resource pooling for databases and services

**Quality Assurance**:

- Automated universal scaffold validation
- Continuous integration testing across worktrees
- Real-time conflict detection and resolution

**Coordination Efficiency**:

- Standardized progress reporting formats
- Automated status aggregation and monitoring
- Emergency protocols for rapid issue resolution
